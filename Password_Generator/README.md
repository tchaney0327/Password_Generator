This will generate a unique password for the user.
__________________________________________________

I create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. You will find a clean and polished user interface that is responsive. The app will adapt to multiple screen sizes. About: Use this app to generate unique passwords between 8 and 128 characters that can include upper case letters; lower case letters; special characters; and numbers.

This application will create an unique, user generated password.  The user with have the following options to create thier unique password:


--Between 8 and 128 Characters
--Uppercase
--Lowercase
--Numbers
--Special Characters

The application will run in the browser and use JavaScript promts and alerts to guide the user through the password generation process.  If proper password critera is not met, the display will return 'Critera Not Met'.
